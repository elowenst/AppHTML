        <p>Microsoft wants you to ditch your password. For good, this time.</p>
        <p>
          The company announced
          <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/the-passwordless-future-is-here-for-your-microsoft-account/"

            >in a blog post</a

          Wednesday that it will give users the option to access their accounts
          without using a password.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can choose between downloading the Microsoft Authenticator app;
          a security key; a verification code sent to your phone or secondary
          email address; or
          <a
            href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2015/03/17/windows-hello-lets-you-log-in-with-your-face/24899503/"

            >Windows Hello</a
          >, a biometric option that involves scanning your face, iris or
          fingerprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Authenticator app, for example, users get notified on their
          smartphone during a login attempt, and receive a prompt confirming
          their identity.

          Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president for security, compliance and
          identity at Microsoft,
          <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/the-passwordless-future-is-here-for-your-microsoft-account/"

            >said in the blog</a

          post that the new option tackles two problems: complex passwords
          people can't remember and passwords that do not offer enough security
          because they're too simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nobody likes passwords. They’re inconvenient," Jakkal wrote. "They’re
          a prime target for attacks. Yet for years they’ve been the most
          important layer of security for everything in our digital lives – from
          email to bank accounts, shopping carts to video games."
        </p>
        <p>The feature will be rolled out in the coming weeks.</p>

          Jakkal said there are 579 password attacks every second, which amounts
          to about 18 billion annually; one reason that occurs is that internet
          users tend to create basic passwords.

            >According to security firm NordPass</a

          "123456789."

          Several apps have stepped forward to help users manage their
          passwords, including NordPass,

          creating passwords for each account, and using a mix of upper- and
          lower-case letters, numbers and symbols to make them tougher to crack.
